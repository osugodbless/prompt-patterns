## Climate Change
Climate change refers to long-term changes in Earth’s temperature and weather patterns. While climate has naturally shifted over millions of years, current climate change is largely driven by human activities—especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), which trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the planet.

### Causes

The main causes of modern climate change include:

* **Burning fossil fuels** for electricity, transportation, and industry
* **Deforestation**, which reduces the number of trees that absorb CO₂
* **Agriculture and livestock**, which release methane and other gases
* **Industrial processes** that emit greenhouse gases

### Effects

Climate change affects both the environment and human societies. Major impacts include:

* Rising global temperatures
* More frequent and intense heatwaves
* Melting glaciers and rising sea levels
* Stronger storms and flooding
* Droughts and food insecurity
* Loss of biodiversity

These effects can disrupt economies, damage infrastructure, threaten health, and increase inequality—especially in vulnerable communities.

### Why It Matters

Climate change is not just an environmental issue; it is also a social, economic, and political challenge. Because the world is interconnected, its impacts cross borders. Addressing it requires global cooperation, scientific research, innovation, and policy action.

### Solutions

Efforts to combat climate change focus on:

* Transitioning to **renewable energy** like solar and wind
* Improving **energy efficiency**
* Protecting and restoring forests
* Promoting sustainable agriculture
* Developing clean technologies

Individuals can also contribute by reducing energy use, minimizing waste, and supporting climate-conscious policies.

In summary, climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time, requiring urgent and collective action to ensure a sustainable future.

Instructional: "Write a 200-word explanation of climate change for high school learners.
```

Climate change refers to long-term changes in Earth’s average temperature and weather patterns. While the climate has changed naturally in the past, scientists have found that today’s rapid warming is mainly caused by human activities. When people burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for electricity, transportation, and industry, they release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a “greenhouse effect” that warms the planet.

As global temperatures rise, the effects become more noticeable. Glaciers and polar ice are melting, causing sea levels to rise. Some regions experience stronger storms and floods, while others face longer droughts and heatwaves. These changes can affect food production, water supply, wildlife, and human health.

Climate change is a global issue because its impacts cross national borders. Addressing it requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, switching to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, protecting forests, and using resources more efficiently. Individuals can help by conserving energy, reducing waste, and supporting environmentally friendly practices.

Understanding climate change is important because today’s actions will shape the planet’s future.

**Transformed Prompt (comparative pattern):**
```
Comparative: "Compare the effects of climate change on coastal vs inland regions in 5 bullet points.
```

**Response (comparative pattern):**
```
* Sea-Level Rise vs Drought: Coastal regions face rising sea levels and coastal flooding, while inland regions are more likely to experience prolonged droughts and water shortages.

* Storm Impact: Coastal areas are highly vulnerable to hurricanes, cyclones, and storm surges, whereas inland regions often face intense heatwaves and severe thunderstorms.

* Erosion vs Land Degradation: Coastal zones experience shoreline erosion and saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies, while inland areas face soil degradation and desertification.

* Economic Disruption: Coastal economies dependent on fishing, ports, and tourism are threatened by ocean changes, while inland economies—especially agriculture—are heavily affected by changing rainfall patterns and extreme heat.

* Population Displacement: Coastal communities may be forced to relocate due to flooding and rising seas, whereas inland populations may migrate because of crop failure, water scarcity, or extreme heat conditions.

### Document the improvement in clarity and usefulness of the outputs.

1. The first general prompt response was more broad in terms of explanation and provided a lot more detailed information.
2. The second response (instructional prompt response) was more focused and concise. It respected the 200 words limit given. And it was much more simplified.
3. The comparative prompt response was also concise and focused on just comparing the effects of climate on the two regions given.
